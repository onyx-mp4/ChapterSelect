![The image is a demonstration of the Chapter Select mod in action. It shows
a bar along the top (navigated with your shoulder buttons or Q/E) titled 'Chapters' and a list of Episodes on this bar.
It's structured similar to the Settings Menu. 'Episode 1' is selected. Below this top bar a grid of scenes is shown. Each
scene consists of a thumbnail image with a title below it. The first 3 scenes are shown, while the rest of the scene items
are obscured heavily, with the titles replaced with question marks. The second scene is selected, and the title is 'Morning'](.github/img/demo.png "Chapter Select Demo")

This is a mod for Goodbye Volcano High on Steam. It allows you to jump back to scenes you have played.

It aims to be as in-line with what a chapter select would've looked like if it were included in the original game.

For a scene to be selectable, you must have played it. Unplayed scenes/episodes will be obscured. This will not unlock extra
content.

"Restart from here" is not possible with this mod. This is a limitation of the game's save system.

## Installing The Mod

### A Guide/Walkthrough with images exists at https://onyx-mp4.github.io/
